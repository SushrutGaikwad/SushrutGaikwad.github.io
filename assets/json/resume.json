By coupling these forecasts with meteorological and vegetation indices, the authors produce dynamic PM2.5 emission estimates, achieving a correlation of ≈ 0.8 for next-day predictions and moderate skill for days two and three, suggesting a practical route to more accurate short-term air-quality forecasts."}],"skills":[{"name":"Programming","level":"Master","icon":"fa-solid fa-hashtag","keywords":["Python","R","SQL","MATLAB","Object Oriented Programming","LaTeX"]},{"name":"Data Science","level":"Master","icon":"fa-solid fa-hashtag","keywords":["Data Cleaning","Exploratory Data Analysis","Statistical Analysis","Feature Engineering","Feature Selection"]},{"name":"Machine Learning","level":"Master","icon":"fa-solid fa-hashtag","keywords":["Time Series Forecasting","Predictive Modeling","Classification and Regression Analysis","Deep Learning"]},{"name":"Frameworks","level":"Master","icon":"fa-solid fa-hashtag","keywords":["Scikit-learn","TensorFlow","PyTorch","MLFlow","Optuna"]},{"name":"Libraries and Tools","level":"Master","icon":"fa-solid fa-hashtag","keywords":["Pandas","NumPy","Dask","FastAPI","Docker","Git and GitHub","DVC","Streamlit","PySpark","AWS","Excel"]},{"name":"Visualization","level":"Master","icon":"fa-solid fa-hashtag","keywords":["Matplotlib","Seaborn","TensorBoard","Tableau"]}],"languages":[{"language":"English","fluency":"Fluent","icon":""},{"language":"Marathi","fluency":"Native speaker","icon":""},{"language":"Hindi","fluency":"Native speaker","icon":""}]}
